# Monte-Carlo-Sphere-Volume-
This project uses the Monte Carlo method to estimate the volume of a sphere. It performs simulations to calculate an average result and a confidence interval. Random points are generated using the genrand64_real1 function. Written in C, it includes functions for volume estimation and simulations.
